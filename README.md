## 🙄 How to Use
### Clone this repository
```bash
git clone 
```
### Open Chrome Extension
1. Go to the Extensions page by entering chrome://extensions in a new tab. (By design chrome:// URLs are not linkable.)
- Alternatively, click on the Extensions menu puzzle button and select **Manage Extensions** at the bottom of the menu.
- Or, click the Chrome menu, hover over More Tools, then select Extensions.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3. Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
- Select this repository folder "/src"

Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no extension icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension.
